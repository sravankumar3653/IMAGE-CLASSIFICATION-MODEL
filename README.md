DESCRIPTION:

An image classification model is a type of machine learning system designed to categorize images into predefined classes. Here's a concise description:

Purpose:
------------
To take an image as input and output a label or probability distribution over a set of categories.
How it Works:
----------------
Typically uses deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to learn features from images.
CNNs analyze images by extracting hierarchical features, starting with basic edges and textures and progressing to complex object parts and whole objects.
The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images, allowing it to learn the relationships between visual features and categories.
Key Components:
----------------
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from images.
Pooling Layers: Reduce the dimensionality of feature maps.
Fully Connected Layers: Make final classification decisions.
Applications:
---------------
Object recognition (e.g., identifying cars, animals).
Medical image analysis (e.g., detecting diseases).
Image search.
Autonomous driving.
In short:
--------------
Image classification models use deep learning to automatically recognize and categorize objects within images.
